=========
D-2010.06
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version D-2010.06.

*  For enhanced consistency, the PrimeTime Reference Methodology now uses the
   following naming convention for output files:

      <Design_Name>_<report_file>.report

   For example, the timing report output file name for a design named MyDesign
   is MyDesign_report_timing.report.

*  For interface logic model (ILM) and extracted timing model (ETM) generation,
   all the generated model output files are saved in the RESULTS_DIR directory:

   o  DMSA : Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis
   o  cwd : Current Working Directory
   o  RESULTS_DIR : Results
   o  :: DMSA : cwd/work/scenario/Results
   o  :: Non-DMSA : cwd/Results

*  The Link to TetraMax feature now produces the report global slack output file
   by using the report_global_slack command.


=============
D-2009.12-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version D-2009.12-SP2.

*  This release introduces Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology
   scripts, which you can select in RMgen on SolvNet.

   For more information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts,
   see SolvNet article number 029774 at
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/029774.html.

*  The reference methodology directory structure has been reorganized for all
   versions of the product reference methodologies.

   o  The setup files have been moved to a new directory named rm_setup.

   o  The scripts directory has been renamed rm_<prod>_scripts, where <prod> is
      the product identifier: dc, icc, pt, or tmax.

   These changes are the same for every product reference methodology and apply
   to both the standard and Lynx-compatible versions of the reference
   methodology scripts.

   The working directory structure depends on whether you are using a standard
   reference methodology flow or a Lynx-compatible reference methodology
   flow.

*  You can now control whether PrimeTime continues when an error is encountered by
   configuring the variable sh_continue_on_error in the generated reference
   methodology script.

   The Continue on Error option and the Infrastructure option group have been
   removed from RMgen on SolvNet.


=========
D-2009.12
=========

This section describes new features, changes and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version D-2009.12.

*  New options have been added to the PrimeTime Reference Methodology settings
   in RMgen:

   o  Fast Analysis Mode has been added as a secondary option that appears when you
      select the PTSI setting for the Flow option.

      This new option allows you to configure PrimeTime SI to improve performance
      while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

   o  Multicore Mode Configuration has been added as a secondary option that appears
      when you set the Multicore Mode option to enable the distributed multicore
      analysis flow.

      This new option configures the distributed multicore analysis flow to send
      processes to either the compute farm or a local reserved machine.

*  Support has been added for distributed multicore analysis in PrimeTime VX.

*  Changes have been made to some of the variables in pt_setup.tcl:

   o  The following distributed multicore analysis flow variables have been removed:

      set dsta_cpu_type      ""
      set dsta_mem_free      ""
      set dsta_mem_avail     ""

      Enter all of the submit commands and options in the dsta_submit_cmd variable
      by using either of the following commands:

      -- set dsta_submit_cmd "/grid/bin/qsub -b y -P bnormal -l \"cputype=amd64\""
      -- set dsta_submit_cmd "/lsf/bin/bsub -R rusage\[mem=500\]"

   o  The following variable has been added for distributed multicore analysis flow
      with a local reserved machine configuration.

      set dsta_hostname ""


C-2009.06-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP2.

*  Changes have been made to the settings for preexisting options in the RMgen
   graphical user interface (GUI) configuration:

   o  The Analysis Type option has been removed.

   o  The Use Multiple Constraint Files option has been removed and the
      Advanced OCV Mode option has been changed to a primary option.

      Previously, the Advanced OCV Mode option was a secondary option that was
      available only when the Use Multiple Constraint Files option was set to TRUE.

      The script now contains a CONSTRAINT_FILES variable that you can use to list
      all of your constraint files. The USE_MULTIPLE_CONSTRAINTS_FILES and
      SINGLE_CONSTRAINT_FILE variables have been removed from the script.

*  Constraint files can be either Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC) files or
   tool command language (Tcl) files.

   The file type is identified by the file name extension. The PrimeTime Reference
   Methodology now supports both types of constraint files.

*  For Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA) runs, you can now set the
   derating variables by entering numeric values. For example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_clock_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09

   In previous versions, the mode and corner had to be embedded in the value. For
   example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value "mode1_corner1_1.09 mode2_corner1_1.20"


C-2009.06-SP1
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP1.

*  New settings for preexisting options within the RMgen GUI configuration:

   o  The HIER_FLOW variable has been changed to TIMING_MODELS.

   o  The TIMING_MODELS (formerly HIER_FLOW) SUBBLOCK option has been
      changed to USED_IN_DESIGN.

   o  The default in the GUI for CRPR_MODE is now POST,  in prior releases
      it was PRE.

   o  The CRPR_THRESHOLD variable has been removed.

   o  The following DERATE variables have been removed:

      1. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_CLOCK
      2. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_DATA
      3. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_EARLY	
      4. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_LATE

      The new DERATE variables are:

      1. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_EARLY
      2. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_LATE
      3. DERATE_MODE_DATA_EARLY	
      4. DERATE_MODE_DATA_LATE

      This produces up to four set_timing_derate statements in the
      generated scripts.

*  Support for PrimeTime PX has been extended to the Distributed Multi-Scenario
   Analysis (DMSA) flow in the RMgen GUI.

*  Support for the Link-to-TetraMAX flow has been extended to the Distributed
   Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA) flow in the RMgen GUI.


C-2009.06
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version C-2009.06.

*  New power analysis flow using PrimeTime PX available within the RMgen GUI.

   Power Analysis is supported only in the generic flow,

*  New link-to-TetraxMAX flow available within the RMgen GUI.

   This link-to-TetraMAX flow is supported only in the generic flow,


B-2008.12-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version B-2008.12-SP2.

For this release, the following additions have been made to the PrimeTime Reference
Methodology:

*  New settings for preexisting options within the RMgen GUI configuration:

   For Multiple Constraint Files, added secondary option Advanced OCV Mode File.
   This option is supported only in the generic and distributed multi-scenario
   analysis flows.

*  New PrimeTime multicore flow available within the RMgen GUI.

   Multicore is supported only in the generic flow,
   PrimeTime does not support multicore in distributed multi-scenario analysis mode
   or in PrimeTime VX.

*  New hierarchical flow supports both the generation and use of hierarchical
   subblocks.

   o  In RMgen GUI for PrimeTime, changed Hierarchical Model to Hierarchical Flow.
      -- The primary options are generation, subblock, or off.
      -- The secondary options are etm, ilm, or both.

   o  Before you can use ILM subblocks in the PrimeTime Reference Methodology,
      you must edit the pt_setup.tcl file.

   Example 1 shows the variables that need to be edited.

   Example 2 shows variables in the common_setup.tcl file, These variables impact
   only the IC Compiler Reference Methodology and the Design Compiler Reference Methodology.
