Introduction
============
The following information describes how to enable and run explore mode with parallel structure
which will prepare run directories in parallel such that you can submit each run as individual jobs to
computer farms.

Below is the comparison of the existing explore mode versus explore mode with parallel structure:

Existing explore mode:
  When you invoke the Makefile, each run starts and continues sequentially with the
  same design library and original working directory.

Explore mode with parallel structure:
  When you invoke the Makefile, the following steps will run automatically:
  - create a temporary design library from the same technology information specified in your icc_setup.tcl
  - copy a common starting CEL to the library (minimizing the diskspace for each run)
  - parse through icc_dp_scripts/macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl to identify the runs
    the name of the subdirectory and the run script are derived from the "run number" specified in macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl
  - create a subdirectory for each run
  - copy the design library, link scripts and output directories to associated subdirectories
  - create a run script containing only one run from the original icc_dp_scripts/macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl file
  Parallel explore mode will not submit jobs, it only prepares the directories and files.
  You will need to create a simple script to submit jobs based on your computer farm settings.
  An example script is shown in Usage section if you're using GRD


Instructions to Enable Explore Mode with Parallel Structure
===========================================================
1. Copy prepare_parallel_feasibility.tcl to flat_dp.tcl
   This replaces original flat_dp.tcl with a new script which now has 3 options for ICC_DP_EXPLORE_MODE
   The options are:	false    (No explore mode)
			true     (Existing explore mode)
			parallel (Explore mode with parallel structure)

   UNIX> cp icc_dp_scripts/prepare_parallel_feasibility.tcl icc_dp_scripts/flat_dp.tcl

2. Set ICC_DP_EXPLORE_MODE in the icc_setup.tcl file to parallel
   This will enable explore mode with parallel structure
   (To disable explore mode with parallel structure, set ICC_DP_EXPLORE_MODE to true)


Instructions to Use Explore Mode with Parallel Structure
===========================================================
1. Run Makefile as shown:

   UNIX> make dp (or make flat_dp)

   When the run is completed, you will notice several directories are created.
   If you do not modify the icc_dp_scripts/macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl file, there will be 9 run directories.
   Each of the run* directories will have a corresponding run*.tcl file.
   If you have modified the macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl file, the name of the run directory and run script
   will reflect the names you provided in the macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl file.

2. Prepare a simple script with your environment settings to submit jobs for each run.
   An example for GRD follows:

	#!/bin/csh -f
	set run_dir_list = (run0 run1 run2 run3 run4 run5 run6 run7 run8)
	set icc_exe = /installation_path/icc_shell
	foreach run_dir ($run_dir_list)
	        cd $run_dir
	        touch $run_dir.csh
	        echo "#\!/bin/csh -f" >> $run_dir.csh
	        echo "$icc_exe -f $run_dir.tcl | tee $run_dir.log" >> $run_dir.csh
	        chmod -R 755 $run_dir.csh
	        qsub -your_options $run_dir.csh
	        cd ../
	end

3. When all runs are completed, the results will be in the same directories that are linked to your original
   working directory. From the original working directory, we can now generate the HTML file:

   UNIX> icc_dp_scripts/gen_explore_table_for_parallel
