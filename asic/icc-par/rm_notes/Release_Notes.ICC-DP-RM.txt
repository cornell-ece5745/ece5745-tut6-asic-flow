D-2010.03-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP2.

*  Multicore support has been added for explore mode by replacing the
   "-num_cpus $vfp_num_cpus" command in proc_explore.tcl with the
   "set_host_options -max_cores $ICC_NUM_CORES" command.


D-2010.03-SP1
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03-SP1.

Note:
   The D-2010.03-SP1 IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology is
   compatible with the IC Compiler version D-2010.03-SP1-1.

The following files have been renamed:

*  feasibility_dp.tcl has been renamed flat_dp.tcl.

*  explore.tcl has been renamed macro_placement_exploration_dp.tcl.

All the scripts and makefiles have been updated.


D-2010.03
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version D-2010.03.

*  This release introduces Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology
   scripts, which you can select in RMgen on SolvNet.

   For more information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts,
   see SolvNet article number 029774 at
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/029774.html.

*  The reference methodology directory structure has been reorganized for all
   versions of the product reference methodologies.

   o  The setup files and makefiles have been moved to a new directory named
      rm_setup.

   o  The scripts directory has been renamed rm_<prod>_scripts, where <prod> is
      the product identifier: dc, icc, pt, or tmax.

   These changes are the same for every product reference methodology and apply
   to both the standard and Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology
   scripts.

   The working directory structure depends on whether you are using standard
   reference methodology scripts or Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts.

   Due to the directory structure change, the procedure for running the reference
   methodology scripts has changed from previous releases. For example, to run the
   IC Compiler Design Planning Reference methodology scripts, enter

   % make -f rm_setup/Makefile dp

   See README.ICC-DP-RM.txt if you need more details.

*  The explore.tcl script and related supplementary scripts have been updated to
   use the new create_qor_snapshot command behavior.

*  The variable ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE is now set to TRUE by default.

*  A new variable, REPORTS_DIR_DP, has been added for a step-specific design
   planning reporting directory.

   If you want to have a specific report directory for the design planning step,
   use REPORTS_DIR_DP instead of the REPORTS_DIR variable. By default, the tool
   writes all the reports to REPORTS_DIR and there is no impact on existing usage.

   The icc_setup.tcl file and all scripts have been updated.


C-2009.06-SP4
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP4.

*  Exploration mode now supports Zroute.

   To use Zroute in exploration mode, set the variable ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE to true.
   If ICC_DP_EXPLORE_USE_GLOBAL_ROUTE is also set to true, ICC_DP_USE_ZROUTE has
   higher precedence and route_zrt_global is used instead of route_global.

*  A new variable, ICC_DP_EXPLORE_CUSTOM_PG_SCRIPT, has been created for custom
   power and ground (PG) strap creation.

   Use ICC_DP_EXPLORE_CUSTOM_PG_SCRIPT to source a customized PG strap script in
   explore mode after running create_fp_placement to replace the power network
   synthesis step.

   This new variable is effective only when ICC_DP_EXPLORE_STYLE is set to either
   placement_only or no_pns_pna.


C-2009.06-SP3
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP3.

*  A placeholder has been added after the optimize_fp_timing command in
   icc_dp_scripts/baseline.tcl and proc_explore.tcl to allow you to source your
   customized preroute_standard_cell script.

   A new variable, CUSTOM_ICC_DP_PREROUTE_STD_CELL_SCRIPT, has been created
   for this feature in icc_setup.tcl.

*  A DISPLAY check before invoking the graphical user
   interface (GUI) for explore mode has been added in
   icc_dp_scripts/feasibility_dp.tcl and proc_explore.tcl.


B-2008.09-SP3
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version B-2008.09-SP3.

*  In icc_dp_scripts/proc_explore.tcl

   o  Replaced "write_floorplan -placement {io hard_macro soft_macro}" with
      "write_floorplan -create_terminal -create_bound -row -track -preroute
      -placement {io hard_macro soft_macro}"


B-2008.09-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version B-2008.09-SP2.

*  In icc_dp_scripts/explore.tcl

   o  Updated objectives for run6, run7, and run8

*  In icc_dp_scripts/proc_explore.tcl

   o  Added write_def

*  In icc_dp_scripts/gen_explore_table.pl, feasibility_dp.tcl, and baseline.tcl

B-2008.09-SP1
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version B-2008.09-SP1.

*  In icc_dp_scripts/explore.tcl and proc_explore.tcl

   o  Added a control "macros on edge stacking" for set_fp_placement_strategy -name
      num_rows_to_stack -value


B-2008.09
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the IC Compiler
Design Planning Reference Methodology version B-2008.09.

*  In icc_dp_scripts/proc_explore.tcl

   o  create_qor_snapshot is replaced with create_qor_snapshot -qor -timing -
      constraint

*  In icc_dp_scripts/explore.tcl

   o  Legend: macros on edge default value is changed to auto which is the new
      default in B-2008.09

   o  Column C (macros on edge) of "run0 default" is changed to auto

   o  Naming of run1, run2, run3, run4, and run5 have been changed to use "moe"
      instead of "macros_on_edge"

*  In icc_scripts/init_design_icc.tcl

   o  Related to design planning, if you have physical only cells, you can use the
      variable ICC_IN_PHYSICAL_ONLY_CELLS_CREATION_FILE in icc_setup.tcl to specify
      a file to source create_cell commands e.g. create_cell {physical_only_cell1
      physical_only_cell12} cell_master_name

   o  Related to design planning, if you have physical only cells, you can use the
      variable ICC_IN_PHYSICAL_ONLY_CELLS_CONNECTION_FILE in icc_setup.tcl to
      specify a file to source your PG connection commands e.g.
      derive_pg_connection -power_net $MW_POWER_NET -power_pin $MW_POWER_PORT -
      ground_net $MW_GROUND_NET -ground_pin $MW_GROUND_PORT -cells
      {physical_only_cell1 physical_only_cell2}
