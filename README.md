ECE 5745 Tutorial 6: Automated ASIC Flow
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
6 on the automated ASIC flow. Tutorial 5 introduced students to the key
tools used for synthesis, place-and-route, and power analysis, but this
previous tutorial required students to enter commands manually for each
tool. This is obviously very tedious and error prone. An agile hardware
design flow demands automation to simplify rapidly exploring the area,
energy, timing design space of one or more designs. Luckily, Synopsys
tools can be easily scripted using TCL, and even better, the ECE 5745
staff have already created a flow using mflowgen to allow students to
leverage a much more automated flow to create their designs.
